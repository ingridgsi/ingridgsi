### Hi there 👋 I'm Ingrid :D

As an enthusiastic and curious woman, I have developed a passion for the Tech field after working as an IT recruiter.
Currently, I'm learning how to code and pursuing a career as a Full-Stack developer. 👩🏻‍💻

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating webpages to practice what I've been learning.
- 😀 I enjoy cooking, reading, and watching series in my free time.
- 📫 You can reach me by sending a message [here](mailto:isg.ingridguimaraes@gmail.com).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I walk 6 km every day in the morning 🚶🏻‍♀️🚶🏻‍♀️🚶🏻‍♀️
